My Mini Project

What the Project Does?<br>
This project is a solar tracking solar panel system designed to maximize energy efficiency by 30% by continuously aligning the panel with the sun’s position throughout the day. It automatically resets to the default eastward position after sunset to prepare for the next day's tracking.

Why the Project Is Useful?<br>
Increased Energy Output: By following the sun’s movement, the panel captures more sunlight compared to fixed panels, resulting in higher power generation.
Efficient Energy Utilization: Optimizes solar energy collection, making it ideal for sustainable energy applications.
Cost-Effective: Enhances the efficiency of solar power systems without requiring extra panel installations.

How Users Can Get Started with the Project?<br>
Hardware Setup: Assemble the system with solar panels, sensors (like LDRs), motors, and a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi).
Software Installation: Upload the tracking algorithm to the microcontroller to control the panel’s movement.
Testing & Calibration: Ensure the panel correctly follows the sun and resets at night.
Deployment: Install in an open space with maximum sunlight exposure.

Where Users Can Get Help with the Project?<br>
Documentation: A guide on system assembly and software setup (if available).
Online Forums: Communities like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or renewable energy forums.
Contact Developers: Users can reach out to the project maintainers for troubleshooting.
